      "Strong bullish momentum breaking key 1.0950 resistance with high volume confirmation. Target 1.1080 resistance zone.",
    detailedSummary:
      "EUR/USD has formed a compelling bullish setup with a clean break above the 1.0950 resistance level that has held for 3 weeks. The breakout occurred with 40% above-average volume and strong momentum indicators. Multiple confluences align including 50-day MA support, bullish divergence on RSI, and USD weakness following dovish Fed commentary. Risk-reward ratio of 1:2.8 offers excellent opportunity for swing traders. Key risk is false breakout if price closes back below 1.0950 within 24 hours.",

      "GBPJPY testing 185.50 range support with oversold RSI. Expecting bounce to 188.00 resistance in established range.",
    detailedSummary:
      "GBP/JPY has been trading in a well-defined range between 185.50 support and 188.50 resistance for the past two weeks. Price is currently testing the lower boundary with RSI showing oversold conditions below 30. The pair has respected these levels on four previous occasions, making this a high-probability range trade. BoJ intervention concerns limit upside above 189.00, while BoE hawkish stance provides underlying GBP support. This setup offers a 1:1.8 risk-reward targeting the middle of the range initially. Main risk is range breakdown if global risk sentiment deteriorates sharply.",
