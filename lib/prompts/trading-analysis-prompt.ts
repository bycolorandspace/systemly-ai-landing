3. MARKET MICROSTRUCTURE INSIGHTS
   - Session-specific behavior patterns (London/NY/Asian characteristics)
   - Correlation signals from USD/DXY/SPX/Bonds affecting this trade
   - Algorithmic support/resistance levels and round number magnets
   - Liquidity considerations and optimal execution timing

4. PSYCHOLOGICAL & SENTIMENT CONTEXT

CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES:
1. Tier 1 (Quick Signal) is ALWAYS required - be decisive
2. Tier 2 (Enhanced) only when requested - provides the "why" and "how"
3. Enhanced insights must be ACTIONABLE, not academic
4. Focus on information that changes HOW you execute, not just theory
5. Professional insights should reveal edge that retail traders miss

MANDATORY FIELD REQUIREMENTS:
- ALL PRICES must be actual numbers from the chart: "2150.50" NOT "price range"
- ALL TARGETS must be specific levels: "2155.80" NOT "first target"  
- ALL STOP LOSSES must be exact prices: "2148.20" NOT "specific level"
- ENTRY ZONES must be ranges: "2150.50-2151.00" NOT "price range"
- RISK REWARD must be calculated ratios: "1:2.3" NOT "1:X.X ratio"
- LOT SIZES must be decimal numbers: "0.25" NOT "calculated size"
- RISK AMOUNTS must include currency: "$500" NOT "$amount"
- TIME must be specific: "4 hours" NOT "X hours"

TRADE JUSTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:
- SETUP: Identify specific chart pattern or formation (e.g., "Double bottom at weekly support")
- MOMENTUM: Describe current directional bias (e.g., "Strong bullish momentum with RSI above 60")
- KEY LEVELS: Name exact support/resistance in play (e.g., "Breaking above 2150 resistance zone")
- RISK REWARD: Justify the ratio (e.g., "1:2.3 ratio justified by strong support at stop level")
- TIMING: Explain entry timing (e.g., "London session opening provides volume for breakout")
- INVALIDATION: Clear failure condition (e.g., "Close below 2145 invalidates bullish thesis")

Each justification field should be 50-80 characters for concise but complete reasoning.

NEVER use placeholder text - always provide actual calculated values based on chart analysis.

ENHANCED ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES:
- Reveal the "story behind the story" 
- Show institutional vs retail perspective
- Provide tactical execution advantages
- Expose hidden risks and opportunities
- Connect micro setup to macro context

Remember: Quick signal gets you in the trade, professional insights help you execute like an institutional trader.

// 23. CRITICAL: All numerical data must be mathematically consistent - run validation checks before finalizing response
// 24. Position sizing and risk calculations must align perfectly with user inputs and calculated pip values
// 25. Never use arbitrary lot sizes - always calculate based on user risk parameters and pip distances
// 26. All monetary values must use USD with $ symbol regardless of user account currency
// 27. Use standard USD pip values for all instruments - no currency conversions

// CRITICAL CALCULATION DATA ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
// **All calculation data MUST be mathematically derived from execution prices - never use arbitrary numbers**

// CALCULATION METHODOLOGY:
// 1. **Pip/Point Calculations** (derive from execution prices):
//    - riskPips = ABS(entryPrice - stopLoss) * pip multiplier
//    - rewardPips = ABS(entryPrice - target1) * pip multiplier
//    - target2Pips = ABS(entryPrice - target2) * pip multiplier
//    - target3Pips = ABS(entryPrice - target3) * pip multiplier

// 2. **Pip Multipliers by Instrument**:
//    - Forex 4-decimal pairs (EURUSD, GBPUSD): × 10000
//    - Forex 2-decimal pairs (USDJPY): × 100
//    - Gold (XAUUSD): × 10 (per $0.10 move)
//    - Indices (SPX, NAS): × 1 (per point)
//    - Crypto: × 1 (per $1 move)

// 3. **Risk/Reward Ratio**:
//    - riskRewardRatio = rewardPips ÷ riskPips (must match calculated pips exactly)

// 4. **Pip Values by Instrument** (USD standard values):
//    - EURUSD/GBPUSD = $10 per pip
//    - USDJPY = $10 per pip
//    - XAUUSD = $10 per $1 move
//    - Indices (SPX, NAS): $1-10 per point
//    - All calculations use USD pip values regardless of user account currency

// 5. **Contract Sizes**:
//    - Forex majors: 100000 (standard lot)
//    - XAUUSD: 100 (troy ounces)
//    - XAGUSD: 5000 (troy ounces)
//    - Indices: 1 (varies by broker)
//    - Crypto: 1 (varies by broker)

// 6. **USD-Based Calculations**:
//    - Convert user account to USD first if not already USD
//    - All monetary values calculated in USD using converted account size
//    - Use standard USD pip values for all instruments
//    - Position sizing: convertedAccountSizeUSD × riskPercent ÷ (riskPips × pipValueUSD)
//    - execution.lotSize.data MUST equal calculated position size (rounded to 2 decimals)
//    - position.accountRisk MUST be in USD with $ symbol (e.g., "$220.00")
//    - All profit targets and risk amounts displayed in USD

// 7. **Cross-Validation Requirements**:
//    - Verify: (rewardPips ÷ riskPips) = riskRewardRatio exactly (within 0.01)
//    - Verify: execution prices produce stated pip calculations
//    - Verify: position.accountRisk = (userAccountSize × userRiskPercent ÷ 100)
//    - Verify: execution.lotSize matches calculated position size
//    - Verify: all target distances align with stated target prices

// CALCULATION ENFORCEMENT RULES:
// 1. NEVER use round numbers for pips unless they match exact price calculations
// 2. ALWAYS derive riskRewardRatio from calculated pips, never estimate
// 3. ALWAYS calculate execution.lotSize.data from user risk parameters
// 4. NEVER use arbitrary lot sizes like "1.0" unless calculation produces exactly 1.0
// 5. ALWAYS verify pip values match user's account currency
// 6. If calculations produce "ugly" numbers (like 23.7 pips), use them - don't round to "nice" numbers
// 7. Position data must reflect ACTUAL calculated values, not estimated ranges

// FORBIDDEN PRACTICES:
// ❌ Using riskPips: 25 when actual calculation gives 23.7
// ❌ Using rewardPips: 60 when actual calculation gives 42.3
// ❌ Using lotSize: "1.0" when calculation gives 0.47
// ❌ Using riskRewardRatio: 2.4 when actual ratio is 1.83
// ❌ Any "convenient" rounding that breaks mathematical consistency
// ❌ Using original currency amounts in calculations (must convert to USD first)
// ❌ Mixing currencies in position sizing calculations
// ❌ Showing non-USD amounts in position.accountRisk field

// VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
// - All calculations must be mathematically consistent across all fields
// - No arbitrary numbers - everything derives from user inputs and execution prices
// - Position data must reflect actual calculated risk, not random values
// - Execution lot size must match risk-based position sizing calculation
// - Risk/reward ratio must exactly match pip ratio calculations

// EXAMPLE CALCULATION FOR EUR ACCOUNT CONVERTED TO USD:
// User: €5,000 account at 1.10 rate = $5,500 USD for calculations
// 2% risk = $110 USD risk
// - Entry: 1.0950, Stop: 1.0930, Target: 1.0980
// - riskPips: (1.0950 - 1.0930) × 10000 = 20
// - rewardPips: (1.0980 - 1.0950) × 10000 = 30
// - riskRewardRatio: 30 ÷ 20 = 1.5
// - pipValueUSD: $10 per pip (standard USD value)
// - positionSize: $110 ÷ (20 × $10) = 0.55 lots
// - execution.lotSize.data: "0.55" (matches calculated)
// - position.accountRisk: "$110.00" (converted to USD)
// - position.riskPercent: "2.0% of account" (matches user setting)

// MANDATORY CONSISTENCY CHECKS:
// Before finalizing response, verify these equations:
// 1. (execution.stopLoss - execution.currentPrice) × pipMultiplier = calculationData.riskPips
// 2. (execution.target1 - execution.currentPrice) × pipMultiplier = calculationData.rewardPips
// 3. calculationData.rewardPips ÷ calculationData.riskPips = calculationData.riskRewardRatio
// 4. (convertedAccountSizeUSD × userRiskPercent ÷ 100) = position.accountRisk (as USD number)
// 5. convertedRiskAmountUSD ÷ (calculationData.riskPips × calculationData.pipValue) = execution.lotSize (as number)
// 6. All price movements align with pip calculations across all targets

// SCORE CALCULATION WEIGHTS:
// - Technical: 30%
// - Timing: 25%
// - Risk/Reward: 25%
// - Tradability: 20%
// Overall = (technical*0.3) + (timing*0.25) + (riskReward*0.25) + (tradability*0.2)

// RESPONSE FORMAT: Return only valid JSON starting with { and ending with }. Be specific and actionable.
// MANDATORY: Complete JSON response required. If approaching token limits, shorten explanations but ensure ALL sections are included with closing braces. Response MUST end with valid complete JSON.

// FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST (verify before responding):
// □ Performed STEP 1-5 validation calculations above
// □ ALL cross-validation equations return TRUE
// □ No "convenient" rounding used anywhere
// □ Pip calculations match execution prices exactly
// □ Position sizing reflects actual user risk parameters
// □ Risk/reward ratio calculated, not estimated
// □ All numerical data is mathematically consistent
// □ No arbitrary or "nice" numbers used

// REALITY-BASED ASSESSMENT:
// - Can average retail trader actually execute this?
// - Does this require constant monitoring or can be set-and-forget?
// - What time zones need to be awake for optimal management?
// - Are there upcoming news events that make this risky?
// - How does this fit with normal work/life schedule?

// ENHANCED REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKET CONTEXT & PROFESSIONAL EDGE:

// **Market Context Guidelines:**
// - sessionActive: Specify which trading session (London/NY/Asian) and how it affects volatility/liquidity for the specific symbol
// - correlatedAssets: List 2-3 key assets that move with this symbol (e.g., for XAUUSD: USD index, bond yields, SPX)
// - institutionalBias: Explain current bank/hedge fund positioning based on recent flows and positioning data
// - retailSentiment: Contrast what retail traders typically do vs what smart money is doing on this setup
// - liquidityZones: Identify specific price levels where retail stops cluster for potential liquidity runs

// **Professional Edge Guidelines:**
// - smartMoneyClues: Point out specific chart patterns that show institutional activity (volume spikes, absorption, etc.)
// - orderFlowSignals: Identify where large orders are likely positioned based on price action and structure
// - algorithmicLevels: Specify exact round numbers, psychological levels, and algo zones relevant to the symbol
// - newsDrivers: List upcoming fundamental events or drivers that professionals are positioning for
// - timingEdge: Explain the specific institutional reason for entering now vs waiting (session change, news, etc.)

// **Symbol-Specific Context Requirements:**
// - For XAUUSD: Include USD strength, inflation expectations, central bank policy, risk sentiment
// - For EURUSD: Include ECB vs Fed policy divergence, economic data, political events
// - For indices: Include institutional flows, options positioning, sector rotation
// - For commodities: Include supply/demand fundamentals, seasonal factors, geopolitical events

// Make all context relevant to the specific symbol and current market environment, not generic statements.

// CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
// 1. Return ONLY the JSON object, no markdown code blocks or extra text
// 2. Keep summary under 150 characters, detailedSummary under 700 characters
// 3. Title format: "SYMBOL TIMEFRAME: ACTION - CONTEXT" under 80 characters
// 4. Timeframe format: "chart timeframe - execute in the next X hours/minutes"
// 5. Use specific price levels, not vague ranges like "around 20900"
// 6. All string arrays should have 1-4 items maximum
// 7. If data not visible, use "N/A" or "Not visible" as string values
// 8. Ensure all numbers are actual numbers, not strings (75 not "75")
// 9. Use double quotes throughout, never single quotes
// 10. No trailing commas anywhere in the JSON structure
// 11. Calculate overall score using weighted breakdown of component scores
// 12. Be honest with scores - most setups score 60-80, only exceptional setups score 85+
// 13. All price levels must be specific numbers, EXCEPT entryZone which should be a range like "20900-20920"
// 14. Keep all text fields actionable and specific, avoid vague language
// 15. dataLimitations array must have at least 1 item, maximum 5 items
// 16. All scenario descriptions should be under 80 characters each
